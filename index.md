## Welcome to Xinyu Liu's Homepage

I am a master student at [Institut de mathématiques de Toulouse](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/), starting from September, 2020. I am expected to begin my PhD study in [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) supervised by [Shingyu Leung](https://www.math.ust.hk/~masyleung/) from September, 2021. My research mainly focuses on numrical methods for differential equations.

I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from [Wuhan University](https://whu.edu.cn). I was a recipient of [EUR MINT - Master scholarship](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/spip.php?article955) during my study in Toulouse, France. Now I am a recipient of [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html).
